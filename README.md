# TSSC Multi-CI Development for RHTAP

This repository contains the innerloop development environment for the Multi-CI translations from the RHTAP Pipelines. This repository can also be directly tested in the CI system as it includes a copy of a sample source app for RHTAP (node.js) as well as a gitops repo for that deployment. This may be moved to a separate repo in future dev mode builds.


 This repo includes Jenkins, Gitlab and Github Actions tests of the scripts

The tasks appear in the `rhtap` directory and are updated manually. Once updated they can be tested locally in the shell or pushed to the appropriate CI system and tested in that CI.

This includes:
  1. A Jenkins shared library to be tested in Jenkins as well as Developer Hub as part of RHTAP. 
  2. A gitlab CI file which can be pushed to gitlab in a fork of this repo to test it
  3. A github actions workflow which can be run manually in this repo or pushed to a test repo to validate. When github actions are created for some of the tasks, this will require publishing to github individual to test. 

## Development Mode 

In development mode, the pipeline scripts can be tested using local shell scripts.

`bash build-pipeline.sh` to run a build which will create the Image, SBOM and other artifacts from your local shell. 
`bash promote-pipeline` to run a promotion script which will run the promotion flow, upload SBOM (some systems) and validate  Enterprise Contract.

The local execution requires binaries to be installed in your cluster on your path. The shell scripts will print error message if any binaries are missing. 

## RHTAP-integrated mode

To test the pipelines in a real RHTAP environment:

1. [Release the Templates](#releasing-to-templates-and-jenkins-library) to your forks
2. [Deploy RHTAP](#deploying-rhtap-for-development) after changing the `DEVELOPER_HUB__CATALOG__URL` in your `.env`
   (see [.env.template](.env.template)) to point to your fork
3. Go to the Developer Hub url in your RHTAP instance, sign in and create a new component
    - Select the CI type that you want to test (Tekton, Jenkins, GitHub actions, ...)
4. Trigger the pipeline that you want to test (typically by creating or merging a PR)
    - Jenkins pipelines need some manual setup first, see [Configuring Jenkins](#configuring-jenkins)
      and [Setting up Jenkins jobs](#setting-up-jenkins-jobs)

### Deploying RHTAP for development

You'll need an OpenShift cluster for deploying RHTAP. Find the supported OpenShift versions in the
Release notes for the [latest version of RHTAP][rhtap-docs] (in the `Compatibility and support matrix` section).
If you have acess to the Red Hat Internal Slack workspace, a good way to provision a cluster can be
to message `Cluster Bot`: `rosa create <version> 6h`.

Once you have a cluster ready:

1. Set up your `.env` file (or `.envrc` or whatever you prefer). Copy the [.env.template](.env.template)
   file and fill in the values according to the inline instructions.
2. `cd` to your local clone of the <https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/rhtap-cli> repo
    - Compile the CLI with `make` if you haven't done so yet
3. Source your `.env` file
4. Run `integration-tests/scripts/install.sh`
5. When finished, the script will print a Homepage URL, Webhook URL and Callback URL.
   Go to the GitHub app that you used for RHTAP integration and set these urls in the settings.

Note: once you've set up your `.env` for the first time, most of the variables will be re-usable
for future deployments.

## Releasing to Templates and Jenkins Library 

### Jenkins 

In order to run in RHTAP via software templates, you need to release to a fork of templates https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-templates and install these into RHTAP. When validated in a fork, send a pull request to the release templates repo. 

In order to run the Jenkinsfile you must push to the Jenkins library https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-jenkins
If you want to use a fork you must update your jenkinsfile to reference your fork repository in the jenkins file. 

```
library identifier: 'RHTAP_Jenkins@main', retriever: modernSCM(
  [$class: 'GitSCMSource',
   remote: 'https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-jenkins.git'])
```

To update forks, in preparation for sending pull requests to the official library locations, you can run ` bash hack/copy-to-tssc-templates` to update your local forked repos and then manually check and push to your branch. 


### TODO - update to include gitlab and gihub 


## Creating a cosign signing secret

Take a look in `hack/create-sign-secret`. If you run the build pipeline in development mode this script would have already been used to create the git ignored file `rhtap/signing-secret-env.sh`, but you can run it again manually to generate a fresh signing secret.

When running in Jenkins, each of the three values generated by that script need to be created as "Secret text" credentials in Jenkins. Use the environment variable name as the credential ID and the long encoded string as the secret.

## Quick-start for testing the build pipeline and the promote pipeline in development mode

Assuming that `QUAY_IO_CREDS_USR`, `QUAY_IO_CREDS_PSW` and `MY_QUAY_USER` environment variables are set and exported already.

```
export REKOR_HOST='' TUF_MIRROR=''
(bash build-pipeline.sh && export MY_IMAGES_TO_VERIFY=$(hack/show-image-ref) && bash promote-pipeline.sh) | tee log.out
```

Note that the MY_IMAGES_TO_VERIFY is a workaround so that the image being verified is the image that was just built. This is only for development purposes. If MY_IMAGES_TO_VERIFY is not set then the image list will be produced by the `gather-deploy-images` script as per usual.

## Configuring Jenkins

Binaries
The agent machines running jenkins (or if on master, that machine will need to have binaries configured for the jenkins user running the pipelines)

These will be checked prior to allowing execution to proceed. If any binaries are missing, there will be an error message printed. Install the required binary and re-run the shell mode or the jenkins agent. 

```
ENV vars:
OK: IMAGE_URL
OK: IMAGE
OK: QUAY_IO_CREDS_USR
OK: QUAY_IO_CREDS_PSW
OK: DISABLE_ACS
OK: GITOPS_AUTH_PASSWORD
OK: POLICY_CONFIGURATION
OK: REKOR_HOST
OK: IGNORE_REKOR
OK: INFO
OK: STRICT
OK: EFFECTIVE_TIME
OK: HOMEDIR
Binaries:
OK: git in /usr/bin/git
OK: curl in /usr/bin/curl
OK: jq in /usr/bin/jq
OK: yq in /usr/local/bin/yq
OK: buildah in /usr/bin/buildah
OK: syft in /mnt/g/wslbin/syft
OK: cosign in /usr/local/bin/cosign
OK: python3 in /usr/bin/python3
Env vars and binaries ok
```

The library requires some secrets to be defined in your Jenkins cluster

There are utility scripts in the hack directory which allow automated setting of the Jenkins Secrets. You will need local env vars, and your Jenkins access token configured. Run the script and it will tell you what you are missing.
It will set the credentials required for the Jenkins pipeline to work.

To set the secrets, run `hack/jenkins-set-secrets`
To validate secrets are set  run `hack/jenkins-get-secrets`

You can also check the credentials view in your Jenkins instance.

### Setting up Jenkins jobs

When you create a Jenkins-based component through Developer Hub (see
[RHTAP-integrated mode](#rhtap-integrated-mode)), you get a repository with a Jenkinsfile.
Import the repository into your Jenkins instance as follows:

1. In the Jenkins homepage, click `+ New Item`
2. Create a project of type `Pipeline`. Give it the same name as the Developer Hub component name.
3. In the next view, in the `Pipeline` section, select Definition: `Pipeline script from SCM`,
   then select SCM: `Git`
4. Fill in your Repository URL, fix the Branch Specifier, save the pipeline
5. You can now run the pipeline manually
